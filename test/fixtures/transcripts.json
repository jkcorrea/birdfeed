[
  "[00:00:00] Check, check, check, check. Hello? Does anybody hear me okay? I think I even got the right mic this time. Okay. Well, welcome everybody.\n\nToday\n\nI'd like to talk a little bit about how to deal with overwhelming situations,\n\noverwhelming emotions, overwhelming. Simply things to do, [00:01:00] um, the, the, the common state that we find ourselves in, in the modern world of just, there's a lot of stuff and I, I don't know where I'm at. and I don't know what to do. Um, but then also like, you know, I'm super, super stressed about something. I'm, I'm super, super afraid of something, you know, things like that.\n\nUh, just when, when stuff gets to be a bit too much and I, I want to talk about, um, two factors that kind of work together to get a positive result. And these two factors, um, we'll call one. Simply listening to yourself. And then the [00:02:00] other, uh, the most common term for it is, is something called the masculine container.\n\nUm, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's described in, in, in several different ways. Um, but it's, it's, it's not really a mainstream idea and it's, it's not, uh, I think talked about nearly enough. Um, but, but that's, that's the most common phrase for it. Um, and that's the one that I'm gonna start with. And I'm gonna start with, uh, a piece that I've, I've probably mentioned before.\n\nUh, but it, it, it really helps you make sense of this. Um, which is, uh, first, first, I'm, I'm gonna give you again, just the, uh, the ordering chaos analogy here. So, uh, think of chaos as a garden, and order as a fence. and a garden. Chaos is the place [00:03:00] where anything could happen and then order as the fence that protects that.\n\nSo the garden is great, anything could happen, but if there's no fence, it's either gonna get run over and destroyed in. In other words, it needs protection or it's going to take over everything and, and uh, and uh, become the wilderness. And that's kind of the essence of chaotic energy, because chaotic energy could be anything, right?\n\nAnd, uh, as, as a result, it, it, it, um, it helps from having orderly forces that it can work with, right? Um, and then the analogy of the fence is, okay, it's this impressive structure. It maybe it's intimidating, it's protecting, but. also. What's the point of it without a garden inside of it? And, and that's, that's where that, that sort of concept [00:04:00] is where the, the, the concept of the masculine container has started to come about is, is me meaning that the, the order, the order component, energetic component of the world, t tends to be able to, to create a scenario where the chaos component can, can enjoy itself, basically can have a good time, can feel safe, can feel creative, can do all of the wonderful things that the chaos component of the universe can do.\n\nAnd this is something that works on a societal level, it works on a relationship level, and it works internally inside of your own mind. And so, um, the way this would work on a societal level, is things like say, uh, rules and regulations and good leadership, right? Those are [00:05:00] sort of orderly components of a society.\n\nAnd when those are in place and they're, they're done well, then what happens is the society starts to do more stuff, do more good stuff. And, uh, a phrase that I use for this is, benevolent order enables positive chaos. The idea there being, if the society has a set of rules that make people do less right, it, it disables positive chaos, then that's a problem, right?\n\nThat's, that's a society that's, that's, that's being, you know, crunched. It's being oppressed, it's being broken down, and that's not, that's not healthy. And then this happens on a relationship level. , um, you know, where, uh, say, um, uh, in, in a relationship, you know, u usually the guy takes on a lot of the masculine energy.\n\nThe girl takes on a lot of [00:06:00] feminine energy. A scenario there would be, um, you know, uh, the guy implements his masculine energy to create a safe, protected space. And then now the girl becomes more playful within that space. And now that's a relationship with much more fun involved, much more delight involved, joy, you know, like all these wonderful experiences that can be experienced.\n\nRight? Um, the way this happens inside of our minds is we can set, uh, guidelines to watch over ourselves where we go, okay, I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take a look at where my mind is going, and maybe there's some places I'm not even gonna go right now. Or there's some places I'm going to listen to, but I'm, I'm gonna, you know, put up boundaries for how I'm gonna act on those thoughts.\n\nRight? I mean, these, these are all broad strokes concepts right now. [00:07:00] But, but this is the general idea, and this is extremely important in terms of emotional processing. And, uh, I, I don't know a better way to describe this, but than by describing a quick story, um, of, uh, just a, a moment that I had in a relationship that, that was, uh, It is, it is very interesting.\n\nAnd, and I, I mean it was very positive, but, but just in terms of like, oh, I can, I can apply this to my own life, what I do inside of my own brain kind of a thing, which was there, there was a moment, uh, when I was, uh, in this relationship where, uh, uh, the girl I was, with was experiencing a lot of anxiety. And my typical response, um, in, in a lot of times had been to, and this is the case for a lot of people, is to back off, right?\n\nTo go, okay, [00:08:00] well this person is anxious. And, uh, well, I I don't want them to be anxious. So what do you need here? Let me get out of your way so that you can deal with this. And what's funny is a lot of times when, when somebody takes on this behavior towards somebody who's anxious, the person gets more anxious, , um, because.\n\nThere's, there's a, sub signal happening of like, like a subtext happening, of, uh, basically you're communicating, oh, well this is concerning, that you're anxious and I'm afraid to deal with this. I, I, I'm gonna let you deal with this, and now you're on your own. Right. And we really don't like that, you know, if, if we're feeling anxious, we want somebody to help us.\n\nRight? And I was, I was sort of going through a learning process myself at this time, and I, I saw that she was getting anxious. I recognized it and I thought, okay, [00:09:00] I'm gonna take on a different behavior here. And, and I walked up to her and I gave her a hug, but I, I, I gave her a hug in a very specific way where I sort of locked my arms around her, where there was space for her to move.\n\nBut I was unmovable. . In other words, I wasn't, you know, locking her down. Right. I wasn't like, Hey, it's fine, , get over it. Right? I wasn't doing that, but I, I also wasn't running away. Right. What I, what I did was I just gave her a light hug where she couldn't move a little bit, right? There was resistance with my arms.\n\nThere was a physical communication of a concept basically of, Hey, I see that you're anxious. I, I'm clear on that. I got that and I'm here to help, and also I'm helping my way at this moment. Right? And it [00:10:00] was fascinating what happened because she had a moment of panic, like, like, I dunno, 15 seconds, five seconds.\n\nAnd, and she sort of reacted and, and, and like really pushed against my arms. I was like, I'm, I'm just gonna stay here for a moment. And she, she, you know, she pushed against my arms and then, and then just like, slowed down in her pushing and then all of a sudden relaxed.\n\nAnd then I, I sort of took her and I, I started just swaying back and forth and it, o obviously like she could have gotten out of my arms. It's not like I'm like, you know, like she's stuck forever. But, but there was just a resistance, just enough to say like, Hey, I'm, I'm trying to communicate like, it's fine, but here's a space for you.\n\nLike, you don't need to go outside this space right now. And I started swaying back and forth so that she started [00:11:00] knocking against the resistance and then she started to let go and she started to sway. And then after a minute or two of that, she looked at me and she said, . It was a really like beautiful interaction.\n\nAnd it's a really fascinating thing\n\nbecause, because what was happening was, was I was, I was looking at the, the experience that she was having, I was, I was honoring it, right? Like I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't trying to like completely take over control, but then I was choosing to make my own decision and then stay strong in the thing that I chose to do in, in re in reaction to, to what she was experiencing, right?\n\nI was showing, uh, an independent sense of leadership, right? And, and it was [00:12:00] exactly what she wanted in that moment. Like, like we ended up like talking a little bit. Later. And she, she was like, this is, this was one of the most, like, this was the best, you know, this was so helpful. Right. And it's, it's an interesting thing that there's ways for us to do this within our own minds.\n\nAnd I'll give a version of this, of, of something that I did, uh, in my own brain that, that was kind of like this, um, was I, I had to get some work done and, and I couldn't get the work done. And, and I was, I was, my brain was just so chaotic. I, I just couldn't get myself to be productive on this thing. And so I went, okay, I, I know I need to get it done, and I know that I am just not, I, I'm in such not a state to get this done.\n\nWhat am I gonna do now [00:13:00] with that information in hand? And I set. up a set of boundaries for myself. And in this case, the set of boundaries was I can either do the work, I can clean my car, or I can go outside on the trampoline . Like those, those were the rules that I gave myself. And I was like, like, let's, let's play this game.\n\nSee what happens if I give myself this set of rules and let myself do whatever I want. And it's weird. A lot of these things that we do for self-development are, are a game we play where it's, it's like two of our own minds interacting with each other. I was, I set these rules and I, and I, and it's like, okay, you can do whatever you want within this, this set of rules.\n\nAnd uh, it was so weird. It was so weird because I did the same thing as I described in, in that little story of the relationship, which was I ping p. . I started to, I sat, I started to do the work and I, I wrote, [00:14:00] like, I, I was, I was writing music at the tomb at the time. I wrote like two notes and I was like, Ugh, I don't wanna do this.\n\nThis is terrible. And I walked out to my car, , and I, I, I picked up like a, a paper cup and walked inside and put it in the trash. And I was like, don't wanna clean my car. This sucks . And then I went over it and, and like bounced on the trampoline for a little bit. And I was like, this is stupid. Like, I don't, like, I don't need to be out here.\n\nLike, I mean, it's nice relaxing day. And I like, I like being out in the backyard, but like, I need to get this done. So I walked back inside and I did two more notes and. Just, I, I went back and forth, like trampoline work, car, car work, trampoline work, trampoline work, car. Like, it was weird because I was, I was trying to let myself run within a set of constraints.[00:15:00] \n\nAnd the wildest thing happened is I started to slow down. I started to write five notes, and then I started to vacuum out, like, you know, one seat area of the car. And then I started to go to the trampoline and sit and do a little bit of breathing. And then I went in and I wrote, you know, a section of music, and then I went to the car, you know, cleaned out a large section of it.\n\nAnd then I went to the trampoline, just sat and meditated. And I, I ended up with a clean car , a finished project and a nap on the trampoline. And it was a really good day.\n\nAnd what was interesting was it was a day that ended with me relaxed, having accomplished something and actually energized, which is [00:16:00] super weird, you know, cuz I was getting stuff done.\n\nBut what I did was, I, I, I set a set of constraints where I had observed my state, I had observed my situation, and I'd given myself options, I'd given myself freedom, right? And that relationship story that I described, I, I, I intentionally mentioned that. Like I put my arms around her, but she was not stuck.\n\nAll right? I had freedom to move. . And then from there it was a, a safe environment for me to express my needs mentally to myself. Where it's like, no, I legitimately don't want to be working on this project [00:17:00] right now. It's like, okay, don't, cool, that's fine, but you can't go watch Netflix right now. . Right. So it was, it was limitations and freedom.\n\nLike, you don't have to do this, but also we're not going over here. Right. And this is something that we do in our own minds. It's something we do in relationships, and it's something we do on the societal level. It, it, it, it's extremely important. It's, it's recognition of the experience that you're having.\n\nAnd then conscious decision to create a set of freedoms and limitations in which you can experience process and then, and make your own decisions within.\n\nAnd [00:18:00] so that's the general idea that I, I want to talk about today, which is comp conscious, ob observation of the self. Um, or, or if, you know, there's, there's things in relationships where you're seeing this play out or things in business, cuz this definitely applies inside businesses. And then, and then choosing to, to consciously create order that there is freedom within.\n\nSo that's the general idea. What are y'all's reaction to this? Anybody have any thoughts or questions? Does this bring up any ideas?\n\nHello? Hi. Yes.\n\n[00:19:00] Yes,\n\nyes.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nYes. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.[00:20:00] \n\nYes.\n\nSo, um, yeah, yeah. What, what you're describing is, is spot on. Um, the, uh, um, it's, uh, I, I, I spoke to you earlier today. Uh, uh, I, I didn't mention, I'm also from Texas, by the way, . Um, and, and, uh, so, uh, I, I have quite a few friends in the Latin culture as well. And, uh, so, um, an, an element of this is, is just the, uh, uh, you know, like the US in, in the us it, it got very first world, right.\n\nYou know, like very wealthy, right? And [00:21:00] those conflicts are, are, uh, they come up more as the culture gets more successful, right? And when there's a lot of external survival structure, Uh, or situations, uh, like has been in some of the Latin communities, that mental conflict sometimes goes away because the external conflict is so clear, right?\n\nBecause it's just like, oh, well we gotta make life work. Like, like, don't, like why you worrying about what's in your head, right? And like, gotta make life work, right? And yeah.\n\nYes,\n\nof course, of course. Yes.\n\nMm-hmm.[00:22:00] \n\nyes. Yeah. Um, and but one other piece, the reason why I mentioned that survival element is, . Uh, a funny thing about the survival element is it is actually a set of constraints in a way. It is a set of limitations that for some people do relax them, right? Where they have less of that con mental conflict in their mind.\n\nUm, like it's well known that, you know, societies that are like really struggling and a and Africa is like third world situations. Um, uh, I, I mean there's some of that in, in, uh, Latin America as well, like, There's very little depression in those situations. Uh, very few people struggle from depression cuz they're struggling with other things.\n\nThey're like, ah, you know, like, I don't need this depression stuff. I'm working on other problems, you know? Um, but it, it, it actually can weirdly ease the mind and times, because it's a set of things [00:23:00] I must survive. And there's only a set of options within, within that. And that can be calming in, in an odd, in an odd way.\n\nUm, uh, um, one, one other thing real quickly, uh, with, with Lisa, uh, we, we had been, when I gave you that suggestion of reaching out to people about writing grants, um, I had this concept in my mind, which was why I gave you such a small thing. It was like, reach out to one person per week. Right? It's a small structure that gives you freedom within it.\n\nUm, Gulu, uh, what's that?[00:24:00] \n\nYes, yes, yes.\n\nThat's a big piece of it. Yes, that's a big piece of it. Um, so yeah. Yeah.\n\nYes.\n\nHmm.\n\nYes. Yes, a hundred [00:25:00] percent. Okay. So, uh, a big piece of this was planning ahead, right? I, I did not wait until I was, uh, mentally a disaster to do this. Uh, I mean, I many times have waited until I was mental a disaster, and then I didn't do it. But, uh, in this story that I described, I, I, I knew where my brain was going, and I was like, all right, like, let me find, like I've, I've had this problem so many times, right?\n\nThe only reason I can do it is cuz I've, I've not done it so many times. I've had this problem so many times. What, what could I, what set of constraints could I set up that would give me a better outcome? And y how do did I pick them? So what I did was I created a balanced set of options that would give me interest, health, like, relaxation, [00:26:00] um, and, and productivity, right?\n\nSo I, I, if, if I, if I wanted to be entertained to some degree, uh, like I used to enjoy like some gymnastics. So like trampoline for me is, is interesting and fun. Uh, so it's, it's like, okay, I can do a playful thing to amuse myself, right? So that's, that's an element of Netflix, right? Um, and then cleaning the car, it's like, I can do this boring patronistic thing.\n\nuh, because that, that's actually very calming in, in a lot of cases, right. You know, like, like organize the spice cabinet, right? Uh, , you know, label stuff, right? Uh, you know, there's times in your life where you, you want like, you know, accounting, you even want to do it sometimes, right? Because it is, it's like, I just want to do this simple thing.\n\nJust let me do this simple thing. So I gave myself a [00:27:00] simple thing and then an entertaining thing, and then a relaxing thing, which was the, just sitting on the, the trampoline out in my backyard. And then, then I gave myself the thing that I wanted to do. So basically it's, it's, it's giving yourself a variety of positive.\n\noptions right? And like, this is well known with kids, right? It's like if you, if you wanna solve the, I don't want that food complaint, you give them like three good options. You know, it's like, or they're like, I want a cookie. And, and it's like, okay, cool. You want a cookie? Would you like this celery, the carrot or, or the, the, the beef, you know, like, you know, like whatever set of things, good things you wanna give your kid, and, and giving them, uh, a freedom of choice within a constraint of healthy options is often the way to [00:28:00] get a kid to do something positive, right?\n\nUh, I, I, this is often done with bedtime rituals, right? Where it's, it's, it's like, you know, well you could go to bed, you could brush your teeth, you could, uh, you could read this book. You could, you know, uh, you know, it, it was, it was a couple of different things. Uh, my best friend just, uh, built a amazing, uh, little fort, uh, over, over, uh, his kid's bed.\n\nHe was having trouble going to bed. And, and of course, you know, the fort was awesome. And, and, and the kid wanted to be in it, but the kid had been, you know, going, I don't want, I don't wanna sleep in the bed. I don't wanna sleep in the bed. So he gave this option of like, well, you, you know, you can sleep where you wanna sleep.\n\nI think he was sleeping in their bed, you know, the parents' bed. And he is like, uh, but we're also going to make this fort, you know, [00:29:00] before we go to bed. . And then, you know, the kids, the kid's like, well, you know, oh. And then dad was like, but you can't sleep in the fort, right? . And then the kid's like, well, I'd like to sleep in the Fort\n\nYou know, dad's like, well, Okay. You know, , you know, I suppose that'd be all right. You know, he's walking away like Yes. Uh, he, you know, it's, it's creating this scenario of options that are, that are all good. Each one that is picked is a win, right? Because it was a win. If I went and exercised on the trampoline, it was a win.\n\nIf I got my, my car clean cuz my car was dirty and it, it was a win if I, um, uh, got the work done. So that, that's, that's kind of the idea of, of, of how to create these constraints. Uh, shale, is that how to pronounce the [00:30:00] name?\n\nShale? Uh, yeah. Hi. What?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nYeah,\n\nyeah,\n\nyeah. Oh, I never do that. . Okay. I do, I do, I do that ? Um, no. So, uh, [00:31:00] usually the reason why, our our weeks are solid and our weekends are awful in the way you just described. is We ha just have too high of expectations where we go, I need to get a hundred things done this weekend. And then you go, well, I can't get a hundred things done, so I'm gonna watch Netflix.\n\nAnd the reality is, you have to get two things done, but you're embarrassed to get two things done. So you're like, well, I can't do that. Uh, like, I should be, I should do more. And then, so then you create the high expectation, and then, and then you, you can't do it. So then, then you, you stop. Did, do you relate to that explanation?\n\nDoes that resonate?\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's like, like some version of that usually. And so, uh, that, [00:32:00] that's one piece. And then there's one other piece, which is usually we legitimately need downtime and play and fun. and we don't plan on good downtime, play and fun. And so as a result of that, our brains rebel and we're like, well, I'm just gonna watch Netflix.\n\nSo you have to give yourself the assignment of a small set of things and then the assignment of some good stuff. You have to actually assign good stuff. . I mean, the guys, I I, I'm talking to so many people now, and almost everybody, their problem is they don't give theirself enough good stuff. Like, like that's, that's the number one problem that I run against is we don't just do good stuff.\n\nlike making [00:33:00] yourself a cup of tea or, or, uh, like. Going to the park or, you know, hanging out with a friend. You know, we, we tend to not do enough of that. Um, but, but, uh, but yeah. Yeah, that, that's, that, that's the general gist. Uh, uh\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, uh, first I want to point out that like, this is different based on psychology, but the, the [00:34:00] method that I use. I think it's not used enough, so I'll, I'll describe it, which is, is I put an over-emphasis on a small amount of accomplishment. My goal is to absolutely smash a small thing. I generally disagree with the theory of setting high expectations to put a fire in your belly to accomplish a big thing\n\nFor me that ha hasn't gotten a lot of success. There are times when that has, can really work. It's worked in the past for me. Um, Alan has, has described, uh, using that method and, and it, and it really getting results. But I've found that also there can be a real heavy. . [00:35:00] Um, that has been the case for me. Um, uh, it was, Alan described there being a price for him as well.\n\nUh, like, like that, that can, it, it, it takes a toll, I think, sometimes to use that methodology. So sometimes it's right, sometimes it's right. Um, Tony Robbins is a big fan of that methodology and, and, uh, in the right context. And I think the right context is when you are, are fueling yourself, caring for yourself and, and like energizing yourself with positive energy.\n\nI think the set a big dream, set a big accomplishment and, and use that to put fire in your belly and, and smash your, your giant goals. Like, I think that's the way to go. But there, there's this other method which is. , you have to just do [00:36:00] five reps in the gym, but they have to be the best reps ever. Right.\n\nWhere it's, it's, it's like, here's this tiny thing. Just, just do it. Amazing. Or, or another analogy is like, you only have to do two pushups, but you need to do it like 200 times today. Right. Or it's, it's, it's like it where it's, it's like you're, you're putting massive energy into, into very, very tiny situations.\n\nUm, that's, that's the method that, that I tend to use to, to, to get myself to do stuff. So, so like with the weekend scenario, it's, it's like what's an absolutely silly, small thing that would make things better? Can I just do that? And nine times outta 10, it gets me really good results to, to [00:37:00] behave that way.\n\nUh, Elias?\n\nYes.\n\nMm, yes.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\n[00:38:00] Yeah. Some of it's actual physical environment where, you know, you, you just get stuff out of the room. You know, if, if, if you don't need the cell phone for the work that you're doing, you just put the cell phone somewhere else. You know, stuff like that. Some of it is just choice. Um, but the part that's really interesting is when you set up these boundaries, often you feel less tension around doing those other things.\n\nYou know, if you set up this game where you say, all right, I'm playing this game of these positive options, all of a sudden you feel a lot more peace around saying no to those other things that you want. The the negative options, um, because we're we're super cap. of going towards the positive when it's, it's within a framework.\n\nUm, right. Uh, somebody mentioned the, [00:39:00] the, the, excuse me. Huh? Um, somebody mentioned the, the weak being positive, but the, but the weakened being, uh, negative and that's often because the weak has structure, right? Like, you're at going to a job, you, you or, you know, some, some form of employment where the life is structured for you.\n\nUm, so that, you know, uh, makes it possible for you to, uh, uh, it, it gives you a sense of, of it gives you a sense of confidence and that that confidence makes you feel, uh, less like you need to, to do these other, other negative things.[00:40:00] \n\nMm.[00:41:00] \n\nYeah. Yeah. The answer is really hard. You suck it up and do four.\n\nYeah. So what I mean by that is, , we have these, uh, beliefs around what we need to do, and,\n\nuh, what's it, [00:42:00] it's, it's, it's actually a really hard one, but we, we, we have these beliefs around what needs to get done, and then we don't get things done. If that's the case, then that's, that's not a good situation, right? That means things aren't getting done. W would you agree with, with that statement, like, it's, it's a dumb statement, but, but like, so\n\nYeah. Mm-hmm.\n\nyes. Yes, yes. So, so what I'm getting at is with that expression of suck it up and just do, do, do less, is we, we have beliefs around what we should do, and some of us [00:43:00] have beliefs around what we should do that don't serve us, where it's, it's like, I should do five things and then that's too many and I don't get anything done.\n\nWell, if that's the case, that's the wrong set of things that you should do. You should actually do four, maybe you should do three, maybe you should do two. Maybe you should do what? The number that you should do is the number that makes you the most productive, preferably the most productive over time.\n\nAnd then whatever that number is, is the number that you have to learn to live with now. If you learn to live with it, you end up starting to do more over time. Like you start to like get way more productive. But we, we tend to create a scenario where it's like, I gotta do this number of things. Ah, I can't do that.\n\nI'm gonna waste time. It's like, okay, that doesn't work. So you have to do less. And then your brain goes, well I don't wanna do less. I feel like a [00:44:00] failure. And to that you have to say, well, too bad it's your job to do less cuz you trying to do more results in no progress. So you have to do the amount that results in some progress.\n\nAnd if you do this and you know that, that's the game. This is the weird part, is embracing the lower number that feels bad and letting yourself feel bad becomes a victory.\n\nit's, it's, it's, it's the way to get around the crap. I have 20 more things that I didn't get to problem because you have to realize, like sometimes it's that sensation of failure. The sensation of I'm not living up [00:45:00] to all of the things that we have to get over and we have, we have to do the, the smaller amount and, and go, well look, this is, this is the thing that gets results.\n\nThis is what has to be done. And then if we do this, we can actually be proud of it cuz we know that we've done the thing that gets us results. Does this make sense? It's kind of a weird.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nMm-hmm. . So what I'm saying is if doing less gets you more results, [00:46:00] then that's what must be done. And if doing less also gives you negative emotion, then you need to be willing to experience that negative emotion anyway. And if you can do that, that's a victory. Cuz that's, that's the thing that like just, it comes with the territory Does.\n\nMake more sense,\n\nit's a victory because it's, it's a victory because you did the thing that got you the most results that you could, even though you didn't feel good about.\n\nit it Um, uh, a Alan,[00:47:00] \n\noh, uh, yeah, Luisa.[00:48:00] [00:49:00] [00:50:00] [00:51:00] \n\nYes, it's, it's, it's weirdly, It's weirdly valuable. Um, and, uh, the, it's, it's, it's, uh, this is strange, but, uh, Jocko Willink, uh, probably a lot of, you're familiar with that guy. The, the, the wild, like military discipline equals freedom guy, uh, you know, wake up at 4:00 AM every morning and go, you know, smash Brazilian jujitsu for five hours and then go do it again five hours af after an hour rest or whatever his life is like, uh, we look at that and, and we think of like, ah, that's what discipline is.\n\nBut the, the reality, I, I think I, I think we misconstrue that because the reality is he's just this extremely powerful human being who's, who's learned to execute on a massive level. I, I don't think that's the core of his message. [00:52:00] The core of his message is, can you gain control over a thing? Can, can you, can you take something.\n\nand consciously act on it. Can you consciously do this thing? And, and it can be very small and, and I, I think, I think the, the conscious control is more important than the overall accomplishment. So if, if you can learn to get yourself to do a thing, that's a victory, right? Um, and, and, and I, I, I think it extrapolate, it, it, it expands out and, and gives you compound results over time.\n\nIt gets, gets you, it gets you where you want to go. Um, Alan,[00:53:00] [00:54:00] [00:55:00] \n\nYes. Uh, Tony Robbins refers to that as chunking, um, you know, breaking stuff up into chunks and it, it's, it's extremely valuable. It's, it's, it's. Essential. Um, another thing that I'd like to do around, around starting is simply allocating a larger amount of time to starting . Uh, we, we tend to think, oh, well, I should just be able to start something.\n\nI should just be able to start something hard. And it's like, what made you think that , what, what made you think you'd be good at like, getting yourself to do something? And so sometimes it's useful to, to say like, okay, like you have a half hour to sit there and then make a cup of tea and then, you know, [00:56:00] organize your, your bookshelf and, and then sit down and then get up and stretch and then sit down and get up and then sit down and then start\n\nThat can be really useful, um, because again, , it doesn't matter how silly you are, it doesn't matter how, how much difficulty it ha it, it, it takes, what matters is if it gets done right, what matters is if you get results, like whatever gets you to get results is the thing to do no matter how silly or, you know, infantile or, or, or bothersome it is.\n\nUm, it's, you know, like many, many composers and artists have talked about having a, uh, you know, like a, a ritual of, you know, sharpening pencils or cleaning paintbrushes or, you know, preparing paints, you know, and that, that being a piece of, you know, what gets them in the [00:57:00] groove. Um, I, I, I think it's, it's, it's extremely valuable to do this.\n\nUm, but uh, yeah, we're, we're coming to a close here. And, um, the, the thing I want to suggest in terms of writing is, uh, Could you, uh, in, in discord, could you, could you write about what are a set of positive options you could give yourself\n\nthat would allow your mind to calm and allow you to become more productive?\n\nThat's, that's the thing we want to look for. And this, this happens in terms of like basic productivity. It, it happens in terms of, of grief and, and, you know, terrible [00:58:00] fears and, you know, all sorts of things. Where you go, you, you have to, to go, okay, this is, this is what's happening to me. What's a set of options that I could.\n\nthat in my life might get me to do something that move me towards better. Um, Goam. Did you, did you have something?\n\nHmm.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So, um, like with, with fears, um, is you, you can create a set of options like, alright, you can do nothing and actually just be in terror. That's okay. Right? Like, that's actually really useful to allow yourself to be afraid. [00:59:00] So that is one of the options of the mini. And then it's like, and this is metaphorical cause like fears operate in different ways, but it's like you are allowed to run five feet away from the thing you are afraid of, but you're not allowed to run away from it.\n\nRight. You know, like you, you're allowed to separate yourself this much from it. You are allowed to, uh, do this dose of the fear, right? Like, uh, it, it's, um, excuse me, uh, a, a common version of this in, excuse me, um, described in, in, uh, uh, therapy is, um, uh, like if somebody has a fear of elevators, it like the, the, they start by just look looking at photographs of elevators, right?\n\nAnd then they learn to walk by elevators and then they learn to look at elevators. , [01:00:00] and then I learned to walk up to elevators and press the button. Then they learned to look at the open elevator. Then they learned to put a foot in the elevator in like each one of these is a step in dealing with the fear.\n\nAnd so you would create a set of constraints in, in the elevator analogy of, of like, okay, let's say we're at the press, the button level of dealing with the elevator fear. Okay, so you are allowed to be in the, the hotel where the elevator is, right? You can't leave. You can't leave the hotel. You're allowed to sit in the chair and not deal with the fear of the elevator, but you can't be on your phone while you're sitting in the.\n\nright? Because like, like you're, you're, you're not like consciously constantly thinking about the elevator cause that's too much stress, but you're not totally distracted just zoning out on your phone. [01:01:00] You can walk up to the elevator, you can look at photographs of the elevator, all the things that you've done before, and you can press the button, right?\n\nAnd so that's a set of scenarios that aren't all deal with the hardest thing ever, right? They aren't all deal with the thing that you're terrified of. Some of them are, are like comfortable things. Maybe you can rent a room in the hotel. You know, like, you know, it's, it, it's, it's a set of things that are good.\n\nUm, uh, and, and then there there's, there, there's a version you could play through this with, with, with any negative emotion. But it's, it's, it's, it's setting up these constraints. So, yeah, that I'd, I'd love for you to experiment with, uh, a little bit of writing this week. Is, is, is, you know, just, just pick anything.\n\nIt could be your day-to-day work. It could be something else that you're working, something specific that you're working on, but [01:02:00] just come up with a volunteer, some ideas of like, I could create a scenario where I could do these five things and I could let myself ping pong between these five things. And this is my set of constraints.\n\nUm, give that a shot. And, uh, I, I think this is a really useful thing. It's, it's, it's been, uh, had a lot of benefit in my life. It's been really significant. Um, give it a try and I'd, I'd love to hear what comes up. So, uh, with that said, um, it's been great chatting and uh, I will see you guys next week.\n\nWhat's thing? Have a good one. Let's see ya.[01:03:00] \n\n"
